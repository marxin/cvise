"""Helpers for working with "hints" - descriptions of edits to be attempted.

A hint is a compact JSON object that describes one or multiple modifications of
the input: deletion of text at a particular location, replacement with new
text, etc.

The usage of hints, as a protocol, allows to simplify implementing reduction
heuristics and to perform reduction more efficiently (as algorithms can now be
applied to all heuristics in a uniform way).
